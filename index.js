  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

  TASK 2
    - Write a Car constructor that initializes `model` and `milesPerGallon` from arguments.
    - All instances built with Car:
        + should initialize with an `tank` at 0
        + should initialize with an `odometer` at 0

        + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.
        + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
    - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:
        + The `drive` method should return a string "I ran out of fuel at x miles!" x being `odometer`.

  TASK 3

/* 
  TASK 4

  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. Global Binding: When applying this to the global scope, it will reference/point to the window object (which is the parent of all JavaScript objects).
  2. Implicit Binding: When applying this to a particular object (invocation via dot notation), it will reference/point to the instance object (and its properties/methods).
  3. New Binding: In the context of a constructor, the "this" will refer to the particular instance being created. It's useful for setting the initial properties of an object.
  4. Explicit Binding: Utilizing the call() or apply() functions will explicitly determine which object the "this" keyword will refer to (based on the instance passed in as an argument).
